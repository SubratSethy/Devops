Concept of virtual machine :
->When we using our personal personal laptop or physical servers we are not completely using the available resources -> CPU,RAM and hardwares etc.Organizations have thousands of servers.They are paying for these resources.

                                                                                    -> vm is a virtual isolation of ps. -> each vms has its own operating system(os).->on top of this os we run our application.
->Instead of running a application on a physical servers we can a lot applications on lot of vms on a single physical servers.
